## Compile

You can compile my while program by the following command:

```
g++ -std=c++11 ./main.cpp ./fraction.cpp
```

And then you can run the executable file by:

```
./a.exe
```



## Test cases

All the test cases are included in the `main.cpp` file, I have written all the comments there, you can check to see that all the results are correct.
