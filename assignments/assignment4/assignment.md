**Requirements**

The Personal Diary is a CLI (Command Line Interface) software that consists of four programs:

```
pdadd 
pdlist [ ]
pdshow 
pdremove 
```

- **`pdadd`** is used to add an entity to the diary for the date. If an entity of the same date is in the diary, the existing one will be replaced. **`pdadd`** reads lines of the diary from the stdin, line by line, until a line with a single `.` character or the `EOF` character (`Ctrl-D` in Unix and `Ctrl-Z` in Windows).
- **`pdlist`** lists all entities in the diary ordered by date. If `start` and `end` dates are provided through command line parameters, it lists entities between the start and the end only. This program lists to the stdout.
- **`pdshow`** prints the content of the entity specified by the date to the stdout.
- **`pdremove`** removes one entity of the date. It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

The software stores the diary in one data file, and reads it to the memory at the beginning of each program, and stores it back to the file at the end of the process.
